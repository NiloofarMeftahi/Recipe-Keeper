Instructions:
To implement the database, we have used Flask 2.0.2, Flask_SQLAlchemy 2.5.1, and SQLite.
Setting up the database framework and external libraries:
 
1. Create a virtual environment by opening the command line and typing:
python3 -m venv /path/to/the/virtualenv
2. Activate the virtual environment by typing this command in the command line:
c:\path\to\the\virtualenv\Scripts\activate.bat
3. Set up the flask environment by opening the command and typing:
pip install Flask
4. Since we are using  SQLAlchemy and SQLite, use these commands in the command line:
pip install pysqlite3
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
Setting up and populating the database:
1. Download project.py from deadline2 directory, copy it in the application folder.
2. In case you are not at the application directory, navigate to it through the command line.
3. To populate the database simply type this command in the command line:
flask run
